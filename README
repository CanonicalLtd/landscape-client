To run the full test suite, you must have a dbus session bus
running. If you don't have one (for example, if you're running the
tests in an ssh session), run the following command:

export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=`dbus-daemon --print-address=1 --session --fork`

Then your tests should pass.

When you want to test the landscape client manually without management
features, you can simply run:

$ ./scripts/landscape-client

This defaults to the 'landscape-client.conf' configuration file.

When you want to test management features manually, you'll need to run as root.
There's a configuration file 'root-client.conf' which specifies use of the
system bus.

$ sudo ./scripts/landscape-client -c root-client.conf
