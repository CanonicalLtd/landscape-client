When making a revision to this package, please update the *last* digit in the
Debian version number. e.g.

  1.0.29-0ubuntu0.9.04.0

should become

  1.0.29-0ubuntu0.9.04.1

In addition, when you build a new package, it would be appreciated if you also
updated landscape/__init__.py to include the entire new version number. This
helps us keep track of exact version of clients in use.
