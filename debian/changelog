    - landscape-client: has all the binaries required to run the
      landscape-client. Requires a landscape account.
    - debian/control: 
      + move some dependencies to landscape-client so that
        landscape-common doesn't install unecessary packages in the 
        default -server install.
      + move python-gobject to a Pre-Depends so that landscape-config can
        register the system during the postinst (LP: #268838).

    - depend on python-smartpm instead of smartpm-core.
  * debian/landscape-client.postrm: delete /etc/landscape/client.conf when

    run in independent processes that exit when they complete so the
    OS can reclaim the memory.

    the unpriviledged landscape user while management functions run as
