# added/changed when we moved the sysinfo manpage from client to common
# in r582. There is no accompaining "Breaks" because -client requires
# the exact same version of -common, which will trigger the upgrade
# and avoid the case discussed in
# http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/footnotes.html#f53
