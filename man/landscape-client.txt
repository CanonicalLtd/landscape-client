NAME
  landscape-client - Landscape system client

SYNOPSIS

  landscape-client [-c FILE, --bus BUS, --pid-file FILE, --daemon]

DESCRIPTION

The landscape-client is the client program for the landscape system
management software. The client is responsible for communicating
system information to the landscape server and executing remote
managment commands on the system.

OPTIONS 
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c FILE, --config=FILE
                        Use config from this file (any command line options
                        override settings from the file).
  --bus=BUS             Which DBUS bus to use. One of 'session' or 'system'.
  -d PATH, --data-path=PATH
                        The directory to store data files in.
  -q, --quiet           Do not log to the standard output.
  -l FILE, --log-dir=FILE
                        The directory to write log files to.
  --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
                        One of debug, info, warning, error or critical.
  --ignore-sigint       Ignore interrupt signals.
  --ignore-sigusr1      Ignore SIGUSR1 signal to rotate logs.
  --daemon              Fork and run in the background.
  --pid-file=PID_FILE   The file to write the PID to.
  --monitor-only        Don't enable management features. This is useful if
                        you want to run the client as a non-root user.

EXAMPLES

To run the client in the foreground, with all logging data printed to standard
IO:

  landscape-client

To run the client in the background with a particular configuration file:

  landscape-client --config=my.conf --daemon

To run the client in the foreground, with a configuration file, but overriding
the bus option:

  landscape-client --config=my.conf --bus=session

If you want to run the client in non-root mode, please use --monitor-only (or
add it to the config file as monitor_only = True) and add the user you want to
run as to the /etc/default/landscape-client file:

  DAEMON_USER=landscape
