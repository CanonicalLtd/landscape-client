NAME
  landscape-config - configure the Landscape management client

SYNOPSIS
  landscape-config [--silent, -a ACCOUNT, -t TITLE, -p PASSWORD, -l LOG,
                    -k KEY, -d PATH]

DESCRIPTION

Before using the landscape-client it must be configured with account and
computer information that is transmitted to the Landscape server when the
client connects. The registration can be performed with or without user
interaction.

Running the landscape-config program without arguments will start the
program, prompting you for the necessary information to run the client.
Optionally you can provide command-line arguments (detailed below) to
specify default responses. You will be told if the registration was
successful or if an error occurred. When registration is successful
Landscape is configured and running on your system. Errors can occur if
you provide incorrect registration details.

registered machine, without requiring user interaction. The client
will be configured to start on boot automatically:

  landscape-config --silent -a account-name -p secret -t `hostname`

Register a machine with the script execution plugin enabled, without
requiring user interaction:
