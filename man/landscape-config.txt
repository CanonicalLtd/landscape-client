NAME
  landscape-config - configure the Landscape management client

SYNOPSIS
  landscape-config [--no-start, -a ACCOUNT, -t TITLE, -t TITLE,
                    -p PASSWORD, -l LOG, -k KEY, -d PATH]

DESCRIPTION

Before using the landscape-client it must be configured with account and
computer information that is transmitted to the Landscape server when the
client connects. The registration is done interactively, by asking the user a
series of questions.

Runnning the landscape-config program with no argument will start the program,
prompting you for the necessary information to run the client. Optionally you
can provide command-line arguments (detailed below) to specify default
responses. You will be told if the registration was successful or if an error
occurred. If the registration is successful then you are done, landscape is
running on your system. Errors can occur if you provide incorrect registration
details.
