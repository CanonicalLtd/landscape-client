NAME
  landscape-sysinfo - Display a summary of the current system status

SYNOPSIS

  landscape-sysinfo [options]

DESCRIPTION

landscape-sysinfo is a utility that displays information about the computer it is run
on. This information is displayed upon login for console users
(ssh and terminal login supported) and can also be seen at anytime
by just calling landscape-sysinfo from the command line.

The information displayed at login time is updated by update-motd. On
systems where update-motd is not available, such as Ubuntu Dapper or
Hardy, the output of landscape-sysinfo is not included.

The output of landscape-sysinfo can be controlled by enabling or
disabling its plugins. See below how to do that.

If the system load is higher than the number of cores, as determined by the
count of processor lines in /proc/cpuinfo, then
landscape-sysinfo will not run at login time. This is to prevent it from
potentially making a bad situation worse by interfering with what could be an
administrator logging in to try to fix the problem causing the high load.

CONFIGURATION FILE

Any of the long command-line options can be used as a configuration directive
in that configuration file, under the section [sysinfo], by replacing the hyphen
(-) with an underscore (_).

For example, to disable the LandscapeLink and Temperature plugins
without having to use the command line option, the following can be added to
/etc/landscape/client.conf:

    [sysinfo]
    exclude_sysinfo_plugins = Temperature, LandscapeLink
